### Problem 1: Manufacturing Flaws in Circuit Boards

```{r, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
library(moderndive)
library(effectsize)
solder = read.csv("solder.csv")
red = read.csv("redlining.csv")
```

#### Part A.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(solder, aes(x=Opening, y=skips))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x="Size of Opening on Solder Gun", y="Number of Skips", title="Relationship Between Size and Number of Skips")

ggplot(solder, aes(x=Solder, y=skips))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x="Thickness of Alloy", y="Number of Skips", title="Relationship Between Thickness of Alloy and Number of Skips")
```



#### Part B.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
lm1 = lm(skips ~ Opening * Solder, data=solder)
#coef(lm1)

coef_table_lm1 <- cbind(
  Estimate = coef(lm1),
  confint(lm1, level = 0.95)
)

coef_df_lm1 <- as.data.frame(coef_table_lm1)
#coef_df_lm1
kbl(coef_df_lm1, digits=2, col.names = c("Term", "Estimate", "Lower", "Upper"))%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = FALSE)
```

#### Part C. 
The baseline number of skips for a large opening with a thick solder is .39. 
The interaction effect for thick solder and a medium opening is 2.41 skips.
The interaction effect for thick solder and a small opening is 5.31 skip. 
The main effect for thin solder is 2.28 skips. This is the effect of thin solder in isolation.
The interaction effect for thin solder with a medium opening is -.74 skips.
The interaction effect for thin solder on a small opening is 9.65 skips.

#### Part D.

To minimize the number of skips, it is best to use a combination of a medium opening and thin solder since it has a negative relationship on skips.


### Problem 2: Grocery Store Prices

#### Part A.
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
groc = read.csv("groceries.csv")

groc = groc %>%
  mutate(store_city=paste(store_city = Store, City, sep=", "))


average_prices = groc %>%
  group_by(store_city) %>%
  summarize(avg_price = mean(Price, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(average_prices, aes(x=avg_price, y=reorder(store_city, avg_price)))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  labs(title="Average Price of Goods Across Different Stores", x="Average Price", y="Store")
```

#### Part B.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
goods = groc %>%
  distinct(Product, store_city)%>%
  group_by(Product) %>%
  summarize(store_count=n())

ggplot(goods, aes(x=store_count, y=reorder(Product, store_count)))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  labs(title="Number of Stores Selling Various Products", x="Number of Stores Selling Product", y="Product")
```

#### Part C. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
lm2c = lm(Price ~ Product + Type, data=groc)
#summary(lm2c)
#confint(lm2c, level=.95)["TypeGrocery",]
```
Compared with ordinary grocery stores (like Albertsons, HEB, or Krogers), convenience stores charge somewhere between
.41 and .92 dollars more for the same product.” 

#### Part D. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
lm2d = lm(Price ~ Product + Store, data = groc)
#summary(lm2d)
#confint(lm2d, level=.95)
```

The two stores that seem to charge the least when comparing the same product are Walmart and Kroger fresh Fare. Wheatsville Food Co-Op and Whole Foods seem to charge the most when comparing the same product.

#### Part E.

With Albertson's as the baseline, H-E-B charges $0.66 less for the same product whereas Central Market charges $0.57 less. This difference of about nine cents does not seem so significant when comparing other similar stores. For example, Kroger charges $0.70 less than Albertson's for the same product on average. On the contrary, a more expensive store like Whole Foods charges $0.36 more for the same product. 

#### Part F.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
groc2 = groc %>%
  mutate(Income10k = round(Income/10000, 0))

lm2f = lm(Price ~ Product + Income10k, data=groc2)
#summary(lm2f)
# -.015
#get_regression_table(lm2f, conf.level = 0.95, digits=2)
#m2f = get_regression_table(lm2f, conf.level = 0.95, digits=2)

#standardize_parameters(lm2f)

```

Using a regression model, I found that people in lower incomes areas tend to pay $0.02 less for the same. A one-standard deviation increase in the income of a ZIP code seems to be associated with a -.04 standard-deviation change in the price that consumers in that ZIP code expect to pay for the same product.

### Problem 3: Redlining

A. True - The trend line in Figure A1 shows a positive relationship between the percentage of a community's residents that are minorities and the number of FAIR policies per 100 housing units.

B. False - The 95% confidence interval for this interaction is -.016 to .912. Since this includes zero, we cannot confidently conclude that there is an interaction occurring.

C. False - Figure C1 shows both a higher intercept and steeper slope for high fire risk homes, but the confidence interval once again includes both positive and negative figures, so the relationship is not definitive.

D. False - Both the models that do and do not control for income show a positive relationship between minority percentage and FAIR policies.

E. True - The multiple linear regression model has a 95% confidence interval of .003 to .014  when income, fire risk, and housing age are controlled for.
